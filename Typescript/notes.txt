to compile ts code: 
    use "$ tsc file.ts file.js "
    tsc = type script compiler
    it compiles ts file into js, which the browser can understand
    hence In the main html file, link to the JAVASCRIPT file
    If the ts and js files both have thesame name, then exclude file.js
        like this: "$ tsc file.ts"
